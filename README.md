## Arguments

### INPUT_PATH

With some exceptions, all ftCLI subcommands process files in the given path. The `INPUT_PATH` argument can be generally
a single font file or a folder containing one or more fonts. In case a directory is passed as INPUT_PATH, all fonts
stored in it will be processed, with the exclusion of fonts stored in subdirectories.

## Common options

The `-out, -output-dir`, `--recalc-timestamp` and `--no-overwrite` options can be used in all subcommands, unless
otherwise specified.

### -out, --output-dir

The directory where the output files are to be saved. If `output_dir` is not specified, files are saved to the same
folder. If the user passes a directory that doesn't exist, it will be automatically created.

### --recalc-timestamp

By default, original `head.modified` value is kept when a font is saved. Use this option to set `head.modified`
timestamp to current time.

### --no-overwrite

By default, modified files are overwritten. Use this switch to save them to a new file (numbers are appended at the end
of file name, so that Times-Bold.otf becomes TimesBold#1.otf).

### Usage examples:

`ftcli metrics align "C:\Fonts" -out "C:\Fonts\Aligned"`

`ftcli metrics copy -s "C:\Fonts\SourceFont.otf" -d "C:\Fonts\" --recalc-timestamp`

`ftcli metrics copy -s "C:\Fonts\SourceFont.otf" -d "C:\Fonts\" --no-overwrite`

## ftcli assistant

A set of tools to correctly compile the 'name' table and set proper values for usWeightClass, usWidthClass, Bold, Italic
and Oblique bits.

**Usage**:

    ftcli assistant

**Commands**:

      commit
      init-config
      init-data
      ui

The logical steps are the following:

1. Create a CSV file containing, for each font in the source path, the following data:
   - File path
   - Family name
   - usWidthClass
   - usWeightClass
   - Slope classes (Italic and/or Oblique) and Bold flag
   - Weight, Width and Slope style names
2. Review the CSV file
3. Write data from the CSV file to the target fonts: this will compile the name table and set the proper
   usWidthClass, usWeightClass Slope class and Bold values.

**Step 1** can be executed with one of the following commands:

- `ftcli assistant init-data INPUT_PATH`
- `ftcli assistant ui INPUT_PATH`

The first command will create a directory named `ftCLI_files` containing two files: `fonts_data.csv` and
`styles_mapping.json`. The second one will open the command line user interface that allows to edit both.

The `styles_mapping.json` is created at first, unless it already exists, and contains the default Style Names to pair
with usWidthClass, usWeightClass and Slope class. The default values are the following:

    {
        "italics": ["It", "Italic"],
        "obliques": ["Obl", "Oblique"],
        "weights": {
            "250": ["Th", "Thin" ],
            "275": ["XLt", "ExtraLight"],
            "300": ["Lt", "Light"],
            "350": ["Bk", "Book"],
            "400": ["Rg", "Regular"],
            "500": ["Md", "Medium"],
            "600": ["SBd", "SemiBold"],
            "700": ["Bd", "Bold"],
            "800": ["XBd", "ExtraBold"],
            "850": ["Hvy", "Heavy"],
            "900": ["Blk","Black"],
            "950": ["Ult", "Ultra"]
        },
        "widths": {
            "1": ["Cm", "Compressed"],
            "2": ["XCn", "ExtraCondensed"],
            "3": ["Cn", "Condensed"],
            "4": ["Nr", "Narrow"],
            "5": ["Nor","Normal"],
            "6": ["Wd", "Wide"],
            "7": ["Ext", "Extended"],
            "8": ["XExt", "ExtraExtended"],
            "9": ["Exp", "Expanded"]
        }
    }

After creation of `styles_mapping.json`, all valid font files found in `INPUT_PATH` are parsed to retrieve Family Name,
usWidthClass, usWeightClass, Slope Class (Upright, Italic or Oblique). The process searches for matches between the
retrieved values and the JSON data, trying to determine the proper style names. The results are written into the
`fonts_data.csv` file.

The `fonts_data.csv` contains the following columns:

- `file_name`: path to the font file
- `family_name`: the font's family name, retrieved reading the name table
- `is_bold`: True if ths bold bits are set, False if they are not set. This column is present only for completeness,
  but it's value will be ignored. A font will be set as bold only and only if, while running the `ftcli assistant commit`
  command, the user will choose to use linked styles.
  (-ls / --linked styles) option while writing data from CSV to fonts
- `is_italic`: True if ths italic bits are set, False if they are not set
- `is_oblique`: True if ths oblique bit is set, False if it's not set
- `us_width_class`: usWidthClass value
- `us_weight_class`: usWeightClass value
- `wdt`: short literal for the Width style name
- `width`: long literal for the Width style name
- `wgt`: short literal for the Weight style name
- `weight`: long literal for the Weight style name
- `slp`: short literal for the Slope style name
- `slope`: long literal for the Slope style name
- `selected`: 0 to exclude the file while writing data from CSV to fonts, 1 to include the file

Both files can be edited manually or using the character interface.

**Step 2** can be executed, after reviewing `fonts_data.csv`, running the `ftcli assistant commit` command.

### ftcli assistant ui

Opens the character user interface to edit the `styles_mapping.json` and `fonts_data.csv` files. If one or both files
do not exist, they will be automatically created.

**Usage**

    ftcli assistant ui INPUT_PATH

The main window displays a list of fonts found in `INPUT_PATH` and allows to access the editors for
`styles_mapping.json` and `fonts_data.csv`.

The Main Window:

When the `fonts_data.csv` file contains the desired values, data are ready to be written to fonts using the `ftcli
assistant commit` command.

### ftcli assistant commit

Writes data from CSV to fonts.

**Usage**:

    ftcli assistant commit [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH

**Options**:

      --width-elidable TEXT           The width word to elide when building the
                                      namerecords.  [default: Normal]
      --weight-elidable TEXT          The weight word to elide when building the
                                      namerecords.  [default: Regular]
      -ls, --linked-styles <INTEGER RANGE INTEGER RANGE>...
                                      Use this option to activate linked styles.
                                      If this option is active, linked styles must
                                      be specified. For example: -ls 400 700, or
                                      -ls 300 600.
      -x, --exclude-namerecords [1|2|3|4|5|6|16|17|18]
                                      Name IDs to skip. The specified name IDs
                                      won't be recalculated. This option can be
                                      repeated (for example: -x 3 -x 5 -x 6...).
      -swdt, --shorten-width [1|4|6|16|17]
                                      Name IDs where to use the short word for
                                      width style name (for example, 'Cn' instead
                                      of 'Condensed'). This option can be repeated
                                      (for example: -swdt 1 -swdt 5, -swdt 16...).
      -swgt, --shorten-weight [1|4|6|17]
                                      Name IDs where to use the short word for
                                      weight style name (for example, 'Md' instead
                                      of 'Medium'). This option can be repeated
                                      (for example: -swgt 1 -swgt 5 -swgt 6...).
      -kwdt, --keep-width-elidable    Doesn't remove the width elidable words (by
                                      default, "Nor" and "Normal").
      -kwgt, --keep-weight-elidable   Doesn't remove the weight elidable words (by
                                      default, "Rg" and "Regular").
      -sslp, --shorten-slope [4|6|16|17]
                                      Name IDs where to use the short word for
                                      slope style name (for example, 'It' instead
                                      of 'Italic'). This option can be repeated
                                      (for example: -sslp 3 -sslp 5 -sslp 6...).
      -sf, --super-family             Superfamily mode. This option affects name
                                      IDs 3, 6, 16 and 17 in case of families with
                                      widths different than 'Normal'. If this
                                      option is active, name ID 6 will be
                                      'FamilyName-WidthWeightSlope' instead of
                                      'FamilyNameWidth-WeightSlope'. Mac and OT
                                      family/subfamily names will be FamilyName /
                                      Width Weight Slope' instead of 'Family Name
                                      Width / Weight Slope'.
      -aui, --alt-uid                 Use alternate unique identifier. By default,
                                      nameID 3 (Unique identifier) is calculated
                                      according to the following scheme:
                                      'Version;Vendor code;PostscriptName'. The
                                      alternate unique identifier is calculated
                                      according to the following scheme:
                                      'Manufacturer: Full Font Name: Creation
                                      Year'.
      -obni, --oblique-not-italic     By default, if a font has the oblique bit
                                      set, the italic bits will be set too. Use
                                      this option to override the default
                                      behaviour (for example, when the family has
                                      both italic and oblique styles and you need
                                      to keep oblique and italic styles separate).
                                      The italic bits will be cleared when the
                                      oblique bit is set.
      --no-auto-shorten               When name id 1, 4 or 6 are longer than
                                      maximum allowed (27 characters for nameID 1,
                                      31 for nameID 4 and 29 for nameID 6), the
                                      script tries to auto shorten those names
                                      replacing long words with short words. Use
                                      this option to prevent the script from auto
                                      shortening names.
      -cff                            If this option is active, fontNames,
                                      FullName, FamilyName and Weight values in
                                      the 'CFF' table will be recalculated.
      -out, --output-dir DIRECTORY    Specify the directory where output files are
                                      to be saved. If output_dir doesn't exist,
                                      will be created. If not specified, files are
                                      saved to the same folder.
      --recalc-timestamp              Keep the original font 'modified' timestamp
                                      (head.modified) or set it to current time.
                                      By default, original timestamp is kept.
      --no-overwrite                  Overwrite existing output files or save them
                                      to a new file (numbers are appended at the
                                      end of file name). By default, files are
                                      overwritten.
      --help                          Show this message and exit.

### ftcli assistant init-config

**Usage**:

    ftcli assistant init-config [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH

**Options**

    -q, --quiet  Suppress the overwrite confirmation message if the config.json
                 file already exists.
    --help       Show this message and exit.

If, for some reason, the user needs to create or reset the `styles_mappings.json` file to the default values, this
command will serve the purpose. Not needed if `ftcli assistant ui` is used.

### ftcli assistant init-data

Creates the CSV database file `fonts_data.csv` in the `ftCLI_files` subdirectory. Not needed if `ftcli assistant ui`
is used.

**Usage**:

    ftcli assistant init-data [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH

    -s, --styles-mapping-file FILE  Use a custom styles mapping file instead of
                                    the default styles_mapping.json file located
                                    in the ftCLI_files folder.
    -q, --quiet                     Suppress the overwrite confirmation message
                                    if the fonts_data.csv and/or styles_mapping.json
                                    files already exist in the ftCLI_files folder.
    --help                          Show this message and exit.

### ftcli converter ttf2otf

Converts TTF fonts (or TrueType flavored woff/woff2 web fonts) to OTF fonts (or CFF flavored woff/woff2 web fonts).

**Usage**:

    ftcli converter ttf2otf [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH

**Options**:

    -t, --tolerance FLOAT RANGE   Conversion tolerance (0-2.5, default 1). Low
                                  tolerance adds more points but keeps shapes.
                                  High tolerance adds few points but may change
                                  shapes.
    --safe                        Sometimes Qu2CuPen may fail or produce
                                  distorted outlines. Most of times, use of '--
                                  safe' will prevent errors by converting the
                                  source TTF font to a temporary OTF built using
                                  T2CharstringsPen, and then reconverting it to
                                  a temporary TTF font. This last one will be
                                  used for TTF to OTF conversion instead of the
                                  source TTF file. This is slower, but safest.

## ftcli metrics

Vertical metrics tools.

**Usage**:

    ftcli metrics [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

**Options**:

    --help  Show this message and exit.

**Commands**:

    align
    copy
    set-linegap

### ftcli metrics align

Aligns all fonts stored in INPUT_PATH folder to the same baseline.

To achieve this, the script finds the maximum ascender and the minimum descender values of the fonts stored in the
INPUT_PATH folder and applies those values to all fonts.

This can produce undesired effects (an exaggerated line height) when one or more fonts contain swashes, for example. In
such cases, it's better to copy the vertical metrics from a template font to one or more destination fonts using the
[`ftcli metrics copy`](#ftcli-metrics-copy-metrics) command.

See https://kltf.de/download/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf for more information.

**Usage**:

    ftcli metrics align [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH

**Options**:

                                  that, in OS/2 table, sTypoAscender and
                                  sTypoDescender values are set, respectively,
                                  equal to maximum real ascender and minimum
                                  real descender, and the sTypoLineGap is set to
                                  zero. Use '--with-linegap' to set
                                  sTypoAscender value to the maximum ideal

                                  the minimum ideal descender (calculated from
                                  letters g, j, p, q and y). The sTypoLineGap
                                  will be calculated as follows: (real ascender
                                  + abs(real descender)) - (ideal ascender +

### ftcli name del-mac-names

Deletes all the Macintosh namerecords from the name table, except nameIDs 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

According to Apple (https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6name.html), "names with
platformID 1 were required by earlier versions of macOS. Its use on modern platforms is discouraged. Use names with
platformID 3 instead for maximum compatibility. Some legacy software, however, may still require names with
platformID 1, platformSpecificID 0".

**Usage**:

    ftcli name del-mac-names [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH

**Options**:

    --del-all                     Deletes also nameIDs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6.
    -out, --output-dir DIRECTORY  Specify the directory where output files are

                                  be created. If not specified, files are saved
                                  to the same folder.
    --recalc-timestamp            Keep the original font 'modified' timestamp
                                  (head.modified) or set it to current time. By
                                  default, original timestamp is kept.
    --no-overwrite                Overwrite existing output files or save them
                                  to a new file (numbers are appended at the end
                                  of file name). By default, files are

                                    If the `OS/2.fsSelection` bit is set, the
                                    font has `name` table strings consistent
                                    with a weight/width/slope family without
                                    requiring use of name IDs 21 and 22.
