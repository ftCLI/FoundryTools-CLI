    Fix the ``kern`` table by removing pairs that contain unmapped glyphs.

    fontbakery check id: com.google.fonts/check/kern_table

    Rationale:

    Even though all fonts should have their kerning implemented in the ``GPOS`` table, there may
    be kerning info at the ``kern`` table as well.

    Some applications such as MS PowerPoint require kerning info on the kern table. More
    specifically, they require a format 0 kern subtable from a kern table version 0 with only
    glyphs defined in the ``cmap`` table, which is the only one that Windows understands (and
    which is also the simplest and more limited of all the kern subtables).

    Google Fonts ingests fonts made for download and use on desktops, and does all web font
    optimizations in the serving pipeline (using libre libraries that anyone can replicate.)

    Ideally, TTFs intended for desktop users (and thus the ones intended for Google Fonts) should
    have both ``kern`` and ``GPOS`` tables.

    Given all of the above, we currently treat kerning on a v0 ``kern`` table as a good-to-have (
    but optional) feature.

    Rationale:

    If the ``space`` and ``nbspace`` glyphs have different widths, then Google Workspace has
    problems with the font.

    The ``nbspace`` is used to replace the space character in multiple situations in documents;
    such as the space before punctuation in languages that do that. It avoids the punctuation to
    be separated from the last word and go to next line.

    This is automatic substitution by the text editors, not by fonts. It's also used by designers
    in text composition practice to create nicely shaped paragraphs. If the ``space`` and the
    ``nbspace`` are not the same width, it breaks the text composition of documents.

    Fix metadata in monospaced fonts

    fontbakery check id: com.google.fonts/check/monospace

    Rationale:

    There are various metadata in the OpenType spec to specify if a font is monospaced or not. If
        the font is not truly monospaced, then no monospaced metadata should be set (as sometimes
        they mistakenly are...)

    Requirements for monospace fonts:

    * ``post.isFixedPitch`` - "Set to 0 if the font is proportionally spaced, non-zero if the font
        is not proportionally paced (monospaced)"
        (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/post.htm)

    * ``hhea.advanceWidthMax`` must be correct, meaning no glyph's width value is greater.
        (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/hhea.htm)

    * ``OS/2.panose.bProportion`` must be set to 9 (monospace) on latin text fonts.

    * ``OS/2.panose.bSpacing`` must be set to 3 (monospace) on latin handwritten or latin symbol
        fonts.

    * Spec says: "The PANOSE definition contains ten digits each of which currently describes up to
        sixteen variations. Windows uses ``bFamilyType``, ``bSerifStyle`` and ``bProportion`` in the
        font mapper to determine family type. It also uses ``bProportion`` to determine if the font
        is monospaced."
        (https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#pan,
        https://monotypecom-test.monotype.de/services/pan2)

    * ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth`` must be set accurately. "OS/2.xAvgCharWidth is used when rendering
        monospaced fonts, at least by Windows GDI"
        (https://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/15397/#Comment_15397)

    * ``CFF.cff.TopDictIndex[0].isFixedPitch`` must be set to ``True`` for CFF fonts.

    Fixing procedure:

    If the font is monospaced, then:

    * Set ``post.isFixedPitch`` to ``True`` (1)

    * Correct the ``hhea.advanceWidthMax`` value

    * Set the ``OS/2.panose.bProportion`` value to 9 or 3, according to the
        ``OS/2.panose.bFamilyType`` value

    """
    Decompose glyphs with transformed components.

    fontbakery check id: com.google.fonts/check/transformed_components

    Rationale:

    Some families have glyphs which have been constructed by using transformed components e.g.
    the 'u' being constructed from a flipped 'n'.

    From a designers point of view, this sounds like a win (less work). However, such approaches
    can lead to rasterization issues, such as having the 'u' not sitting on the baseline at
    certain sizes after running the font through ttfautohint.

    Other issues are outlines that end up reversed when only one dimension is flipped while the
    other isn't.

    As of July 2019, Marc Foley observed that ttfautohint assigns cvt values to transformed
    glyphs as if they are not transformed and the result is they render very badly, and that
    vttLib does not support flipped components.

    When building the font with fontmake, the problem can be fixed by adding this to the command
